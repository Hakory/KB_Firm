** May, 12th 
Got cut plate from laser cutting company

** May, 14th 
Finished carving case recess for pcb + switch

** May, 15th
Carved reset button and tx0 rxi recesses. Fixed a few things on the CAD circuit file

** May, 16th
Today I etched the pcb that was supposed to make the wire connections.
It was terrible - the toner transfer failed miserably and it was all blurred. I only printed one copy and without my printer working I just went with it hand traced.
I finished it and then procceded to carve out the case.
I then realized that I could do the wire pcb in a different way which would be a lot better and easier.
Make the pcb which is mounted on top of the pro micro like an arduino shield.
Have all wires and connections going to it as was intended but it will be connected to the arduino. That gives the advantage of reducing the total number of wires and space used up in the case. It also allows me to fixate the Pro micro to the case since it's going to be soldered to the PCB and I can screw the PCB in the case - win win win 

The new pcb circuit has already been designed on cad. I have to print it and master the toner transfer method.

I also splintered the case as I tried to fix the carving I did for the pcb to fit the pro micro

The case I glueing and should be fine - that means that the carving is finally done.

I spent some time today trying to get a proper toner transfer. Last night I made quite a few different attempts at getting it right with the iron, it was a no go.

Today I tried with my iron plate. Same outcome. There is just no way for me to do this without a descent way to control temperature.

I looked into photo sentitive paint to apply to the pcb, it exists but I can't find locally. I will explore that path if I ever have to produce these in larger scale.

For my personal project I settled in doing hand traces with a pen.

I will drill all the holes and use them to guide me and draw the circuit. Drilling before hand also guarantees that both layers will be lined up.

After breaking 2 1mm drill bits and messing up a board I've settled on some methods I will try that will 99% work.

- Scoring the PCB and snapping it for a clean cut, using the a straight edge and scoring both sides to get a crisp snap
- Punching the holes with a nail + hammer or something similar prior to drilling. Drilling without it is too difficult on the bits and it is next to impossible to line the hole puncher in the right place.

I will try those things tomorrow but I am certain they will work

Alright it didn't work.
The punching with the nail part was seriously compromised by the transparency. It made the nail dance around and the results were inaccurate. What I settle up on is drawing the circuit, so I pulled out my compass, my squares, rulers and pencil and went to town on it

It worked surprisingly well, it was amazing.

I hope to etch the board tomorrow.

** May, 22nd
Board has been etched and that is it
** May, 23rd 
Keycaps arrived!

I started painting the plate and fixed the carving on the kb

The next steps is to finish this plate assemble get the case ready to roll (solder pro micro to secondary pcb screw it in place and wire the push button + switch)

after that it is matrix pcb time.

** May, 27th
Well I guess I haven't done a good job at writing stuff down. 
I spray painted the plate
I dropped the push button and the switch as neither turned out to be nescessary.
I build the pro micro pcb
then I postponed the matrix pcb because I wanted to get this done before I die of boredom

Today I spent the whole day assembling this thing. I cut thin strips of pcb to serve as my collums. I glued those pcbs in the back of the plate and soldered stuff to it. It was a pretty straight forward assembly proccess just very long and very tedious.

Now I have a fully worring planck. I can start working on the code again. I will update teh list of implementations and things to do.


* To do

** DONE Make wire circuit boad
Print transparency at the office and etch the circuit
V1 was done May, 16th, it was terrible.
I've made a new design decision and redesigned the pcb, the cad has been done

** DONE Carve recess for wire circuit board and pro micro
May, 16th
** DONE Etch wiring PCB v2 
** DONE Fixate push button and sliding switch to the case
** DONE Finish up script

** TODO comment code

** DONE modify code for my planck

** DONE program pro micro

** DONE Keycaps arrive

** TODO Celebreate??


* Future things to implement
** TODO Audio Jack
** TODO Implement kb as note taking device. 
Make it like a keylogger and make it upload to the pc or at least repeat the keystrokes so it can retype it.
** TODO Layers

** TODO Macros

** TODO Bluetooht

** TODO Split planck

** TODO lcd maybe?

# send help. seriously
